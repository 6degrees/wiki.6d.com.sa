# Branching Stratgey

Keep it simple stupid [KISS]  
avoid branches unless for the below conditions:  
- the branch is for `github-pages` version to hold the build files, like this repo
- the branch is to reserve an old major version of the project. _i.e. You are upgrading to `version 2`, make a branch and name it `version 1` to hold the old version_  
  
Goal is to avoid __merge conflicts resolution nightmare__
