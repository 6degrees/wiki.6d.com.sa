# Technical Governance Framework

## 1. Introduction & Purpose

This document establishes technical governance for 6degrees, ensuring consistency, security, and scalability in software development and IT operations.

## 2. Software Development Standards

- **Coding Standards:** Follow industry best practices, including SOLID principles, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid). Use consistent naming conventions, modular code design, and enforce linting rules. Adhere to security best practices such as OWASP Top 10 and implement thorough documentation standards.
- **Version Control:** Use Git with a defined branching strategy.
- **Code Reviews:** Mandatory peer reviews before merging code.
- **Testing:** Implement unit, integration, and end-to-end testing with automated tools.
- **Documentation:** Maintain clear and up-to-date technical documentation.

## 3. Architecture Guidelines

- **Technology Stack:** Define and document the approved tech stack.
- **Microservices vs. Monolith:** Establish principles for service design and scalability.
- **APIs & Integrations:** Follow RESTful, GraphQL, or gRPC standards with proper versioning.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Utilize Terraform, Ansible, or similar tools.

## 4. Security & Compliance

- **Access Control:** Implement least privilege and role-based access control (RBAC).
- **Data Protection:** Ensure encryption in transit and at rest.
- **Security Audits:** Conduct regular vulnerability scans and compliance checks.
- **Incident Response:** Define procedures for security breaches and recovery.

## 5. CI/CD & DevOps Practices

- **Continuous Integration:** Automate builds and tests primarily using GitHub Actions, with support for Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD if needed.
- **Continuous Deployment:** Deploy via standardized pipelines with rollback mechanisms.
- **Infrastructure Management:** Use containerization (Docker, Kubernetes) for scalability.

## 6. Monitoring & Incident Management

- **Observability:** Implement logging and monitoring primarily using Grafana along with Grafana Loki, with support for Prometheus or Datadog as needed.
- **Alerting:** Set up automated alerts for critical failures.
- **Incident Handling:** Define an escalation matrix and response process.

## 7. Governance Roles & Responsibilities

- **Technical Governance Committee:** Composed of lead engineers and architects to review policies.
- **Code Owners:** Assign maintainers for specific repositories or modules.
- **Security Officers:** Ensure compliance with industry regulations.

## 8. Review & Continuous Improvement

- **Quarterly Governance Review:** Assess effectiveness and update policies as needed.
- **Developer Feedback Loop:** Encourage engineers to suggest improvements.
- **Automation & Optimization:** Continuously refine CI/CD and DevOps workflows.
